            <p>
                Appalicious was created by a dad who was looking for a way to help his
                kids with their math homework. An engineer by background, Damir
                often found it challenging trying to explain math concepts in an
                easy, approachable way, and so it was out of his personal struggles
                that sparked the idea for Appalicious.
